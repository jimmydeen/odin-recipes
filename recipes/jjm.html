    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A Korean-Chinese dish that is a very popular fast food among Koreans. Consists of thick, chewy noodles served with a black bean sauce on top. Can also be served with rice instead of noodles, making "Jjajangbap"</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>jjajangmyeon noodles</li>
        <li>½ pound pork belly, cut into ½ inch cubes (about 1½ cups’ worth)</li>
        <li>1 cup of Korean radish (or daikon), cut into ½ inch cubes (about 1 cup’s worth)</li>
        <li>1 cup of zucchini, cut into ½ inch cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup of potato, peeled and cut into ½ inch cubes</li>
        <li>1½ cups of onion chunks</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup and 1 tablespoon of black bean paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of potato starch powder, combined with ¼ cup water and 1 teaspoon of sugar in a small bowl, set aside</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of toasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>½ cup cucumber, cut into thin matchsticks for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir-fry the pork belly in a large, deep wok with 1 Tablespoon of vegetable oil for about 4-5 minutes, until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Pour out the excess pork fat.</li>
        <li>Add radish and stir fry for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add potato, onion, and zucchini and keep stirring for about 3 minutes until the potato looks a little translucent.</li>
        <li>Clear a space in the center of the wok by pushing the ingredients to the edges.</li>
        <li>Add 2 Tablespoons of vegetable oil to the center of the wok, then add ¼ cup of black bean paste and stir it with a wooden spoon for 1 minute to fry it. Then mix everything in the wok and keep stirring.</li>
        <li>Add  2 cups of water to the wok and let it cook with the lid closed for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Open the lid and taste a sample of the radish and potato. If they’re fully cooked, stir in the starch water little by little. Keep stirring until it’s well mixed and thick.</li>
        <li>Add the sesame oil and remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Serve with noodles (jjajangmyeon) or steamed rice (jjajangbap).</li>
        <li>Boil and drain the noodles. Rinse and strain in cold water.</li>
        <li>Put one serving of noodles onto a serving plate and add the jjajang sauce over top. Garnish with cucumber strips and serve immediately with kimchi or yellow pickled radish.</li>
