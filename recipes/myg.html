    <h1>Miyeokguk</h1>

    <img src="myg.jpg"  alt="Korean Traditional Seaweed Soup">

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>A traditional Korean soup dish eaten on birth days and in the few weeks after a mother gives birth. The origin of the dish can be traced back to ancient times, when Koreans noticed whales would eat seaweed after giving birth to their calves. Inspired by this and presuming the health benefits as the reason for the whales postpartum consumption, Koreans implemented this seaweed into a soup and Miyeokguk has been a staple in Korean diets ever since. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Â½ ounce (16 grams) dried miyeok, soaked in cold water for 30 minutes</li>
